# AquaMetrics: Wastewater Management KPI Analysis

AquaMetrics is a project that analyzes key performance indicators (KPIs) for wastewater management to help optimize the efficiency and utilization of treatment plants. The analysis is performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook, with various visualizations to better understand the data and derive actionable insights.

## Project Overview

The goal of AquaMetrics is to provide a data-driven approach to analyzing the performance of wastewater treatment plants. By examining various KPIs, we aim to understand:
1. Which plants handle the highest and lowest volumes of wastewater.
2. The percentage contribution of wastewater from different sources.
3. The most utilized and efficient treatment plants.
4. Day-wise activity patterns for each treatment plant.

## KPI Analysis

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

The following steps were performed to prepare the data for analysis:
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converted date columns and other columns to appropriate data types.
- **Handling Missing and Duplicate Data**: Checked for and handled missing values and duplicates.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new columns such as "Weekday" for further insights.
- **Data Merging**: Combined data from various sources to establish relationships between treatment plants and wastewater sources.
